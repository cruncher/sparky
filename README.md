<h1>Sparky</h1>

<strong>Sparky is a model-agnostic live data binding view layer for your html app.</strong>
Sparky enhances the existing DOM without replacing nodes,
renders multiple changes together at the browser framerate, and
renders data through Django template style filters.
It's also fast and light-weight, weighing in at under 10K compressed.
